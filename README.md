# PomodoroTimer

Productivity comes and goes, and it is sometimes difficult to get work down.
This extension follows the Pomodoro method to complete tasks in a timely manner.

Using CSS, HTML and JS, I created this local extension which has the ability to add tasks,
modify time, start time, pause, and end time. 

To download for local use, clone the repository, go to the top right of the google bar, click right and find manage extensions,
toggle developer mode, unpack the downloaded repository, and enjoy.
